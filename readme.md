# CP-template
Java competitive template
This will help you create and run codes from templates automatically for java and cpp.

## FOR WINDOWS OS (Using CMD)
Support has been added for codeforces, codechef and atcoder.

for codeforces use ```cf```
for codechef use ```cc```
for atcoder use ```atc``` (in platform field)

### To run you need to do the following on windows, you need to run alias.cmd everytime your cmd boots up.
> 1. Create shortcut of alias.cmd
> 2. press Windows+R and type "shell:startup"
> 3. Put your shortcut into that folder. Now you can use alias defined in the alias.cmd.

### How to create codes
> 1. Open create.cmd and edit the line 2 to the path of your templates folder.
> 2. Syntax is ```c <filename> <platform> <cpp or java>``` (default platform is cc, change in create.cmd to change default and default language is java. You need to type cpp everytime to create from cpp template bcz we already type a lot in java :) )

  NOTE: c is defined as alias for creating. You can go to alias.cmd to change it to whatever you like.

### How to run codes
NOTE: You need to have in.txt file in the same folder as the code. in.txt will have inputs given to the code
> 1. Syntax is ```r <filename> <platform> <cpp or java>``` (default platform is cc, change in create.cmd to change default and default language is java. You need to type cpp everytime to create from cpp template bcz we already type a lot in java :) )

NOTE: for codeforces the java template would replace the class name as the filename and would declare the class as public
### How to create contest folder
> 1. ccon <contest name>
  
Note: This will create a folder "contest name" and an input file names in.txt and change directory to that folder. :)
Template has all the templates. You can read them at your convinence.
Top are ProblemSolver class, InputReader, OutputWriter, Number Theory and Debug class and timeit.

> To get the execution time, in the main function set ```checkTimeELAPSED=0``` to 1

#### Maybe future update:  To analyse the bytecode using asm or something to get the variable name. Current verdict is that it cannot be done and I think that is true (and No, reflection does not work for local variables).
